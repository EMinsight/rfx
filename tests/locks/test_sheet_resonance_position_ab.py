"""#677 G1 acceptance: resonance-position A/B on a stacked patch pair.

The issue: toggling ``surface_impedance_f0`` used to change the sheet's
ELECTROMAGNETIC GEOMETRY (node-thin PEC plane -> full-cell conductive
slab), moving resonances before loss entered. Original evidence (a
private design, VESSL GPU): toggling f0 moved two resonances by 1.01
and 3.22 GHz. This module rebuilds the
fixture CLASS as a public, CPU-sized stacked patch pair with the same
mechanism (z-gap-sensitive coupled patch modes over a ground plane at
dz = 31.4 um), and runs the A/B on three realizations of the SAME cells:

  pec     PEC sheets (f0 absent)                — baseline
  f0      #677 node-thin operator               — must match pec
  prefix  the PRE-#677 sigma-fold slab, rebuilt  — negative control,
          by hand via sigma_override              must FAIL the gate

Measured 2026-08-19 (this fixture, 30000 steps, JAX CPU float32,
df = 0.3265 GHz, sheet layers asserted identical at z-indices 6/11/14
both ways):

  pec   modes:  24.5646 / 28.1318 GHz   (settle -3.8 dB: closed LOSSLESS
                                         PEC cavity — the ring-down rule
                                         scope-excludes closed PEC
                                         domains; both A/B runs use the
                                         identical window so truncation
                                         bias cancels in the difference)
  f0    modes:  24.5568 / 28.1275 GHz   (residuals 7.9 / 4.3 MHz,
                                         far below the df floor)
  prefix modes: 25.7561 / 27.0049 GHz   (nearest-peak residuals
                                         +1191 / -1127 MHz — the
                                         spectrum reorganizes wholesale,
                                         same class as the original
                                         1.01/3.22 GHz)

LATTICE OWNERSHIP CONTRACT (#931) — WHAT MOVED AND THE PRE-DECLARATION.
A sheet's footprint is now sampled CLOSED on its two in-plane axes, so a
drawn rectangle realizes exactly, hi row included (§1.3). This fixture's
patch is 5.5 mm long on a 0.25 mm cell with X0 = 3.25 mm, i.e. BOTH x
faces on node lines — exactly the case the old half-open rule shortened.
Measured at build time (no solve): the patch footprint is now x nodes
13..35, 22 Ex edges = 5.500 mm, the drawn length; the old rule realized
13..34, 21 edges = 5.250 mm, 4.55 % short. The y faces are off-lattice
(Y0/dx = 14.5) and are unchanged at 15..33.

PRE-DECLARED before the re-measure (issue #931 phase 2): a patch whose
resonant length grows 4.76 % must drop both modes by about the same
fraction, i.e. 24.5646 -> ~23.44 GHz and 28.1318 -> ~26.85 GHz. If the
re-measured modes do NOT move by roughly one cell's worth of length, the
diagnosis is wrong and the footprint change is not what moved them.
MEASURED_PEC_MODES is re-derived from that run, never re-centred by hand;
until then this lock is red on purpose and RECOMPUTE.md names the run.
The A/B itself (pec vs f0 vs prefix) is a DIFFERENCE and is expected to
survive unchanged — all three arms move together.

Gate (contract G1, log-space with the spectral-resolution floor):
``max(|f_f0 - f_pec|, df) <= max(0.1*FWHM_loss, df)`` per mode. On this
CPU-sized fixture the copper-loss FWHM is far below the window-limited
resolution, so the floor df binds on both sides — the gate then reads
"resonances agree to spectral resolution", which the f0 operator passes
by ~40x margin and the pre-fix realization fails by ~3.5x.
