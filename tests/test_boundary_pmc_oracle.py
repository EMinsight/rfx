"""T7-E Phase 2 — PMC λ/4 cavity mode-ladder oracle (v1.7.2).

Closes critic blocker #5: the shipped PMC tests (tangential-H=0,
dual-boundary Hx sample) prove the PMC hook fires and is a distinct
code path from PEC, but they do not prove PMC is a magnetic wall
(reflection sign convention, quarter-wave resonance).

## Analytic basis

In a 1D-like cavity of length L with PEC at z = L (``E_tan = 0``) and
PMC at z = 0 (``H_tan = 0``, which forces ``∂E_tan/∂z = 0`` at the
wall), the transverse-electric standing-wave modes satisfy

    E_x(z, t) = cos(k_n z) · cos(ω_n t)
    boundary conditions: cos(k_n · L) = 0  =>  k_n · L = (2n + 1) π / 2

giving resonance frequencies

    f_n = c · (2n + 1) / (4 L),     n = 0, 1, 2, ...

So the PEC-PMC ladder is f_0 = c/(4L), f_1 = 3c/(4L), f_2 = 5c/(4L),
spaced at ratio 1 : 3 : 5 : 7. By contrast a PEC-PEC cavity supports

    f_n^{PEC-PEC} = n · c / (2 L),  ladder 1 : 2 : 3 : 4.

The spacing ratio f_1 / f_0 is **3 for PEC-PMC** and **2 for PEC-PEC**;
a pure 2% frequency check on either peak alone cannot distinguish the
two, but the SPACING RATIO does. This test asserts the ladder AND
includes a negative PEC-PEC control.

## Test configuration

- Narrow transverse xy (periodic) to suppress non-axial modes.
- Cavity z-length L locked so f_0 = c/(4L) lies well below the
  source frequency cap and f_1 = 3 f_0 is still covered.
- Gaussian impulse E_x source near the centre of the interior.
- Probe E_x at z = 0.7 L (clear of the n=0 and n=1 nodes).
- Ez DFT over a long run (2048 steps) to resolve the ladder.
- Peak detection finds the two strongest DFT peaks in the
  [0.5 f_0, 4 f_0] band.

## What this oracle pins

1. **Spacing ratio f_1 / f_0 ∈ [2.5, 3.5]**: distinguishes PEC-PMC
   (analytic 3.0) from PEC-PEC (analytic 2.0). Tolerance is wide
   enough to absorb the finite-cavity + discretization frequency
   drift but tight enough to separate the two ladders.
2. **f_0 within 10 % of analytic c/(4L)**: confirms the quarter-wave
   resonance is where PEC-PMC physics predicts.
3. **Negative control**: the same cavity with PMC swapped for PEC
   on z_lo fails the 3.0 spacing ratio (lands at 2.0, PEC-PEC ladder).
